For secure WebSocket usage, replace the empty cert.pem and privkey.pem with the corresponding https cert files. If https cert files generated by letsencrypt, those files would be located at:

    /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/cert.key
    /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.key

where domain is replaced with your domain name.

Then, invode chatServer with '--secure' option:

    Server/chatServer.js --secure
